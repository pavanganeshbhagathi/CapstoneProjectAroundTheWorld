  properties in over 200 countries, including from business hotels, airport hotels, train station hotels, luxury hotels
  and resorts.

  introduce this timely partnership with Trip.com as we see our members are getting anxious to start travelling again,
  with more countries beginning to open up and revive their travel and tourism industries.”
<br><br>
  “This partnership’s objective is to spur tourism and bring more benefits for Enrich members around the world to
  conveniently earn Enrich Miles by booking any of Trip.com’s extensive properties be it for business travel,
  staycations, city breaks, beach holidays, in addition to Miles accrual via flights.”

  they book a hotel stay with a minimum spend of US$150 from 23 July until 30 August 2020.”
